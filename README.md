# catalogue

The Catalogue API allows you to search our museum and library collections.

The documentation is at <https://developers.wellcomecollection.org/catalogue>, and the API itself is published at <https://api.wellcomecollection.org/catalogue>.

This is part of the [Wellcome Digital Platform](https://github.com/wellcometrust/platform).
